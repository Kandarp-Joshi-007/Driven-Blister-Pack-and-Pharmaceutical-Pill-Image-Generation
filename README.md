# Driven-Blister-Pack-and-Pharmaceutical-Pill-Image-Generation
"Driven Blister Pack and Pharmaceutical Pill Image Generation," which leverages Stable Diffusion and Generative AI to tackle the challenge of data scarcity in machine vision.

Overview
The project focuses on generating synthetic datasets of pharmaceutical pill images to fill gaps in existing datasets like MVtec, specifically aiding in industrial and medical applications. The generated datasets can be used for:

Pill Identification
Counterfeit Detection
Quality Control
This repository includes two Colab notebooks:

Blister Pack Image Generation
Pharmaceutical Pill Image Generation
Features
